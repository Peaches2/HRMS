# HRMS
This is a simple C#, ASP.NET web application. 

It holds an SQL database and uses KendoUI Widgets to satisfy key functional requirements.

Suggestions when forking/pulling down the project: 
- Please run the .sql and provide appropriate authentication to your localdb. 
- VS 2013 or higher
- Enable NuGet package restore on Solution
- Build the Solutuon
- Set the UI as the startup project (choose any browser you wish)
- Enjoy :)
